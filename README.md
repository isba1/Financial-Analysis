# Financial-Analysis
Financial Analysis Website

This program provides financial analysis for any user inputted stock. The program accesses an API that provides financial statment data for the user inputted stock. It then provides numerous important metrics for the stock, calculated from the financial statements, provides graphs for some of the metrics over time, and provides ranks for the metrics as well. The program also returns a final rank that is calculated from each of the metric ranks. The program also provides a shortened version of the analysis for the top five stocks in each sector of the stock market.
